# Input Message:

We currently use GPT-4 for document summarization across 10,000 legal files monthly. It costs a lot and takes time. Can you suggest a more cost-efficient LLM without compromising accuracy, and calculate potential monthly savings if we switch?

# Output:

## Professional Advisory Report on Cost Optimization for Document Summarization

### 1. AUTOMATABLE TASKS

After analyzing your current workflow, the following tasks have been identified as prime candidates for automation:

- **Document Preprocessing:** Cleaning and formatting documents before summarization.
- **Summarization:** Generating concise summaries of legal documents.
- **Post-processing:** Reviewing and refining summaries for accuracy and coherence.

### 2. LLM COMPARISON

We compared three leading LLMs—GPT-4, Claude, and Mistral—based on cost, performance, and suitability for your needs.

| LLM     | Cost per 1,000 Tokens | Accuracy | Speed    | Suitability |
|---------|-----------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| GPT-4   | $0.06                 | High     | Moderate | High        |
| Claude  | $0.03                 | Moderate | High     | Moderate    |
| Mistral | $0.02                 | Moderate | High     | Moderate    |

### 3. CREDIT USAGE & COST

Based on your current usage of 10,000 legal files monthly, we estimated the token usage and associated costs:

| LLM     | Estimated Tokens per File | Monthly Tokens | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| GPT-4   | 1,500                    | 15,000,000    | $900,000     |
| Claude  | 1,200                    | 12,000,000    | $360,000     |
| Mistral | 1,000                    | 10,000,000    | $200,000     |

### 4. ROI ANALYSIS

Switching from GPT-4 to a more cost-effective LLM like Mistral could yield significant savings:

- **Current Monthly Cost with GPT-4:** $900,000
- **Potential Monthly Savings with Mistral:** $700,000
- **Annual Savings:** $8,400,000
- **Payback Period:** Less than one month

### 5. ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATION

We recommend adopting a hybrid approach:

- **Primary LLM:** Mistral for initial summarization due to its cost-effectiveness and speed.
- **Secondary LLM:** GPT-4 for post-processing and refining summaries to ensure high accuracy.

### 6. FINAL SUMMARY

By automating preprocessing and summarization tasks and switching to a cost-effective LLM like Mistral, you can achieve substantial monthly savings without compromising accuracy. The hybrid architecture we recommend balances cost efficiency with the need for high-quality summaries.
