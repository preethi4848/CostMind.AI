# Input Message:

We are developing a customer support assistant for our e-commerce platform. It should summarize customer complaints, classify them into categories like delivery, refund, or product quality, and escalate complex or emotional cases to human agents. We want to keep inference costs low while ensuring good quality for escalations. Please recommend the best architecture, estimate monthly costs, and calculate ROI if we expect to save $15,000/month in support costs.

# Output:

## Professional Advisory Report on Cost Optimization for Document Summarization

### 1. Automatable Tasks

#### Identified Automation Opportunities

- **Summarization of Customer Complaints:** Use natural language processing (NLP) to generate concise summaries of customer complaints.
- **Classification of Complaints:** Automatically categorize complaints into predefined categories such as delivery, refund, or product quality.
- **Escalation of Complex Cases:** Identify and flag complex or emotionally charged cases for human review.

### 2. LLM Comparison

#### Comparison of LLMs

- **Claude:** Known for high-quality summarization and classification tasks. However, it may have higher inference costs.
- **Mistral:** Offers a balance between cost and performance. Suitable for mid-tier summarization and classification tasks.
- **Nova:** Cost-effective with reasonable performance. Ideal for straightforward summarization and classification but may struggle with more complex tasks.

#### Recommendation

- **Primary LLM:** Mistral for summarization and classification due to its balance of cost and performance.
- **Secondary LLM:** Nova for initial filtering to reduce the load on Mistral, ensuring cost-efficiency.

### 3. Credit Usage & Cost

#### Estimated Monthly Costs

**Mistral Usage:**
- Tokens per complaint: 500
- Monthly complaints: 10,000
- Cost per 1,000 tokens: $0.10
- Total cost: ((500 tokens × 10,000 complaints) / 1,000 × $0.10 = $500)

**Nova Usage:**
- Tokens per complaint: 200
- Monthly complaints: 10,000
- Cost per 1,000 tokens: $0.05
- Total cost: ((200 tokens × 10,000 complaints) / 1,000 × $0.05 = $100)

**Total Monthly Cost:** $500 (Mistral) + $100 (Nova) = $600

### 4. ROI Analysis

#### ROI Calculation

- Expected Monthly Savings: $15,000
- Total Monthly Cost: $600
- Net Monthly Savings: $15,000 - $600 = $14,400
- Payback Period: ($600 / $14,400 per month ≈ 0.04 months) or approximately 1.2 days.

### 5. Architecture Recommendation

#### Recommended Architecture

- **Initial Filtering:** Use Nova to filter out simple complaints that do not require further processing.
- **Summarization and Classification:** Use Mistral to summarize and classify the remaining complaints.
- **Escalation:** Automatically escalate complex or emotionally charged cases to human agents based on predefined criteria.

### 6. Final Summary

Implementing a customer support assistant using Mistral for summarization and classification, supplemented by Nova for initial filtering, will significantly reduce operational costs while maintaining high-quality service. The estimated monthly cost of 600 dollars results in a net monthly savings of $14,400, with a payback period of approximately 1.2 days. This architecture ensures cost-effectiveness and efficient handling of customer complaints.
