### 🏷️ Project Title:
**AI Cost Optimization Advisor**

---

### 🧩 Theme:
**AI Agents for Enterprise Efficiency**  
*(Aligned with Lyzr’s theme: building intelligent agents that solve real-world enterprise problems)*

---

---

### 🎯 Goal:
To help enterprise teams **reduce AI implementation and inference costs** by:
- Selecting optimal LLMs for specific tasks
- Estimating credit usage and ROI
- Recommending efficient agent architectures

---

### 👤 Persona:
Acts as a **virtual AI consultant** for:
- Tech Leads
- Product Managers
- AI/ML Engineers
- Enterprise Decision-Makers

---

### 🧠 Problem Statement:
Enterprises are rapidly adopting LLMs for automation, but face challenges in:
- **High inference costs**
- **Model selection confusion**
- **Lack of ROI visibility**
- **Inefficient orchestration of AI agents**

There is a need for a **cost-optimization advisor** that helps teams make **data-driven decisions** about LLM usage, architecture, and ROI.

---

### 🎯 Solution Overview:
**AI Cost Optimization Advisor** is a multi-agent system that:
- Analyzes enterprise workflows
- Recommends optimal LLMs (Claude, Mistral, Nova, GPT-4)
- Estimates credit usage and cost
- Calculates ROI and payback period
- Suggests hybrid agent architectures

It provides a **professional advisory report** that helps decision-makers reduce costs without compromising performance.

---

### 🛠️ Key Features:
- 🔍 **Workflow Analyzer**: Detects automatable tasks
- ⚖️ **LLM Comparator**: Compares cost, latency, and quality
- 💳 **Credit Estimator**: Predicts monthly token usage and cost
- 📈 **ROI Calculator**: Computes savings and payback
- 🏗️ **Architecture Recommender**: Suggests hybrid orchestration
- 📄 **Final Report Generator**: Outputs a business-friendly summary

---

### 🧠 Innovation & Uniqueness:
- **Multi-agent orchestration** using Lyzr Studio
- **Dynamic model switching** based on task type and budget
- **Mock mode** for simulation without credit usage
- **Hybrid LLM strategy** (e.g., Mistral + GPT-4)
- **Enterprise-grade UI** built with **Lovable**

### 🧰 Tech Stack:
| Layer              | Technology Used                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Agent Framework    | Lyzr Studio     |
| Frontend UI        | Lovable + Vercel    |
| LLMs Used          | Claude, Mistral, Amazon Nova, GPT-4       |
| Backend API        | Lyzr Agent API                            |
| Hosting            | Vercel                                    |
| Visualization      | Lovable components                        |

---

### 🧪 Sample Use Case:
> “We use GPT-4 for summarizing 10,000 legal files monthly. It’s expensive. Suggest a cheaper LLM and estimate savings.”

**Output Summary:**
- Switch to **Mistral** for summarization
- Use **GPT-4** only for post-processing
- Save **\$700,000/month**
- ROI: **>800% annually**
- Payback: **<1 month**

### 🛠️ Tools (Agents) Used:
This is a **multi-agent system** composed of 6 specialized agents:

| Agent Name                  | Function                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Workflow Analyzer**      | Identifies automatable tasks from user input                             |
| **LLM Cost Comparator**    | Compares Claude, Mistral, Nova, GPT-4 based on cost, latency, quality    |
| **Credit Consumption Estimator** | Estimates token usage and monthly cost based on agent actions        |
| **ROI Calculator**         | Calculates ROI and payback period based on cost and savings              |
| **Architecture Recommender** | Suggests optimal LLM orchestration and caching strategies              |
| **Final Summary Generator**| Compiles a professional advisory report                                   |

---

### 🧠 Model Selection Logic:
- **Amazon Nova (via AWS Bedrock)**: For low-cost summarization and classification
- **Claude / Mistral**: For reasoning, decision-making, and escalation logic
- **GPT-4**: For high-accuracy post-processing (optional hybrid use)
- **Dynamic Switching**: Based on task complexity and budget
- **Caching**: Intermediate results to reduce repeated inference costs
